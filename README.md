# PDF to PNG Converter

Last summer, we had a road trip, and my daughter prepared a beautiful collage using her iPad. While we could convert the collage to a PDF, there was no straightforward way to convert it to a PNG on the iPad. When I wanted to print out the collage, I realized that all printing places required PNG files. I tried Adobe's converter with the highest settings, but it did not work, especially for collages with many pictures. So, I wrote this code to solve the problem.

This project converts high-definition PDFs to PNG format. It is especially useful for collages with many pictures where other converters fail.
